"""Centralized constants and label definitions for WiringRobot.ConnectionPointDetector.

All label IDs, class names, and configuration constants should be imported from here
to avoid duplication across modules.

The project carries two parallel vocabularies for the same five semantic classes:

  * the original thesis names (Housing, Contact, SnapPoint, CableEntry, LabelSurface),
    kept as the canonical JSON / serialization names for backward compatibility, and
  * the robotic names (Housing, TerminalContact, RailMount, CableEntry,
    IdentificationSurface) used by the ConnectionPointDetector when a
    robot-oriented vocabulary is preferred.

Both share the same underlying integer IDs, so `FeatureClass.CONTACT is
FeatureClass.TERMINAL_CONTACT` and detections stay interchangeable.
